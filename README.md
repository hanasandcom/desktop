# Hanasand Desktop

Native macOS client for Hanasand account, content, security, infrastructure, organization, and developer workflows. It also runs an embedded Swift command bridge that the signed-in mobile app can discover over the local network.

## Run the macOS app

From the repository root:

```sh
swift run Hanasand
```

The package requires macOS 14 or later. The app starts its embedded Swift HTTPS bridge on port `45731`. It creates a unique P-256 TLS key in the macOS Keychain and a self-signed leaf certificate for `localhost` plus every active advertised IPv4 address. The private key stays in Keychain. The app reuses the certificate while its address set is unchanged, reissues it when that set changes, and publishes the lowercase SHA-256 fingerprint of the certificate's DER bytes with the LAN endpoints. The bridge also accepts requests on the Mac itself. Its requests require a short-lived, nonce-protected HMAC session proof derived from the current Hanasand login; unauthenticated requests receive HTTP 401 inside the TLS connection.

The **Albums** section manages private-by-default CDN photo albums, including album names, contents, and invited viewer or contributor access. The **Images** workspace includes the private CDN file library, image previews and favorites, and local image review. CDN file uploads accept images, videos, and other files through the native upload panel. Supported video files up to 50 MiB can be previewed in Desktop. Album thumbnails are loaded through the authenticated CDN session and kept out of the shared URL cache.

### Embedded Swift bridge routes

The bridge exposes these HTTPS routes:

- `GET /health`, `GET /status`, and `GET /commands` remain available to compatible callers. The mobile client sends these as fixed-size `POST` frames.
- `GET /screenshot` returns the current desktop screenshot. The mobile client sends it as a fixed-size `POST` frame; the embedded bridge accepts both methods.
- `POST /command` accepts a command in a JSON body; the same bridge also accepts command query forms.

Commands include status and update checks, AI actions, app-section navigation, browser actions, native dashboard panels, server logs, settings, and remote-desktop controls. Parameterized commands include `codex_prompt:<url-encoded-prompt>`, `mac_control_type_text:<url-encoded-text>`, and `mac_control_pointer_click_at:<x>:<y>`. Keyboard text entry and pointer clicks require macOS Accessibility permission. Use the authenticated client for requests and read `GET /commands` for the names accepted by the running app; unsupported commands return HTTP 400. The bridge returns HTTP 401 when the session proof is missing or invalid.

The bridge uses Network.framework TLS 1.2 or later. The mobile client pins the leaf certificate using its published SHA-256 fingerprint. The bridge also encrypts request and response bodies with AES-256-GCM, and HMAC proofs bind each request body to its method, path, timestamp, and nonce. While the signed-in app is foregrounded, the mobile client sends one request on each one-second slot when a desktop agent is available. Real requests use the next slot; otherwise it sends a status request. The bridge rounds responses to the next one-second boundary. Every request body is 64 KiB and every encrypted response body is 256 KiB. Screenshots are resized and JPEG-compressed to fit that response frame.

This cover traffic adds about 2.6 Mbps (roughly 1.2 GB or 1.1 GiB per foreground hour) while a desktop agent is available, excluding TLS overhead. It adds up to one second of slot wait plus response-boundary delay. The app stops cover traffic in the background and allows up to four outstanding requests; if all four exceed a slot, it skips that frame. Desktop presence discovery refreshes over the Hanasand API at most once every 15 seconds, outside the local frames. An observer of all device traffic can still see those API requests, the destination IP, whether the app is foregrounded, and gaps caused by network failures or a saturated request limit. TLS protects content; fixed frames and scheduled requests reduce the timing and size signals on the LAN bridge.

## Package a macOS update

From the repository root, choose a semantic version and run:

```sh
HANASAND_APP_VERSION=0.1.2 scripts/package-update.sh
```

The script builds and verifies a release `.app`, signs it with `HANASAND_CODESIGN_IDENTITY` when set, or selects the first local Apple Development identity. It refuses a signed package if the certificate's team identifier differs from the app's signed team identifier. The app uses the `com.hanasand.desktop` bundle ID and the `hanasand-desktop` SSO callback scheme. Passkey sign-in is temporarily disabled in the UI and authentication model while a valid Associated Domains signing identity is unavailable; its implementation is retained for later re-enabling. Stable signing keeps macOS privacy permissions such as Screen Recording attached across updates. Setting `HANASAND_ALLOW_ADHOC_SIGNING=1` forces an identity-free ad-hoc signature with no Apple entitlements for a throwaway local build. Such packages use the `local` manifest channel and cannot be assigned a release channel. By default, the script writes `dist/Hanasand-<version>-macos.zip` and `dist/manifest.json`. Set `HANASAND_APP_OUTPUT_DIR` to choose another output directory:

```sh
HANASAND_APP_VERSION=0.1.2 HANASAND_APP_OUTPUT_DIR=/tmp/hanasand-desktop-0.1.2 scripts/package-update.sh
```

The update API reads the exact archive filename recorded in the manifest. Upload the versioned archive and its manifest together, without renaming the archive. For example, from the repository root:

```sh
rsync -az dist/Hanasand-0.1.2-macos.zip dist/manifest.json ubuntu@hanasand:/srv/hanasand/app-updates/
```

The runner helper is intended for a Forgejo update workflow, which needs a macOS runner because SwiftUI cannot be built in the Linux Git container. This checkout includes the helper but no Forgejo workflow definition, so any trigger and automated release steps are outside this repository. Start the runner in the foreground when that external workflow requires it:

```sh
scripts/run-macos-runner-once.sh
```

The script builds the Forgejo runner locally if needed, registers it with `macos` and `macos-arm64` labels, and runs until stopped with `Ctrl-C`.

The remote Codex worker is disabled by default. To enable it for a local checkout, set `HANASAND_DESKTOP_START_CODEX_WORKER=1`; set `HANASAND_DESKTOP_REPO_ROOT` to this repository's root if the app is launched with a different working directory.

## Capture visual smoke screenshots

On macOS, run the screenshot pass from the repository root:

```sh
scripts/smoke-screenshots.sh
```

The script builds or launches the Desktop app, opens sections through authenticated `POST /command` requests, checks the screenshots, and saves a manifest and browsable HTML contact sheet under `.artifacts/desktop-smoke-<timestamp>/`. It prompts once for the Hanasand user ID and session token; token input is hidden. The script does not load session credentials from environment variables or files. A local CryptoKit helper reads the desktop leaf certificate from Keychain, verifies the exact DER SHA-256 fingerprint during TLS, derives request proofs, encrypts command payloads, and verifies/decrypts response bodies in memory. The helper binary is placed in the smoke output directory; neither credentials nor plaintext response bodies are written there.

Useful options:

```sh
HANASAND_DESKTOP_SMOKE_KEEP_RUNNING=1 scripts/smoke-screenshots.sh
HANASAND_DESKTOP_SMOKE_OUT=/tmp/hanasand-smoke scripts/smoke-screenshots.sh
HANASAND_DESKTOP_AGENT_URL=https://localhost:45731 scripts/smoke-screenshots.sh
HANASAND_DESKTOP_SMOKE_SCOPE=core scripts/smoke-screenshots.sh
HANASAND_DESKTOP_SMOKE_SCOPE=dashboard scripts/smoke-screenshots.sh
HANASAND_DESKTOP_SMOKE_WINDOW_WIDTHS=1080,1512 scripts/smoke-screenshots.sh
HANASAND_DESKTOP_SMOKE_CAPTURE_MODE=rect scripts/smoke-screenshots.sh
HANASAND_DESKTOP_SMOKE_CAPTURE_RECT=80,70,1340,900 scripts/smoke-screenshots.sh
```

The default `full` pass captures Control, Server, Mail, Documents, Images, Dashboard, Settings, and every registered native dashboard route. The script checks route-command coverage before capture. Use `core` for a short shell pass or `dashboard` for dashboard route coverage. Screenshots use the visible Hanasand window ID by default. `HANASAND_DESKTOP_SMOKE_WINDOW_WIDTHS` accepts comma-separated window widths in points; it defaults to `1340`, and `1080,1512` captures each route at both widths. Screenshot labels include the width. Each manifest entry records the requested `layout_points` separately from `dimensions`, which retains the screenshot's actual pixel dimensions. Set `HANASAND_DESKTOP_SMOKE_CAPTURE_MODE=rect` to capture a rectangle, or use `HANASAND_DESKTOP_SMOKE_CAPTURE_MODE=screen` and clear `HANASAND_DESKTOP_SMOKE_CAPTURE_RECT` for a full-screen capture.

## Legacy C++ loopback helper

`main.cpp` builds a separate, minimal helper for cases that do not need the macOS GUI. It is not the Swift bridge: it binds only to `127.0.0.1`, exposes `GET /health`, `GET /status`, and `POST /command`, and returns status output when the request text contains `status`; other command text returns HTTP 400. It does not parse the JSON command field, and it has no LAN discovery or the Swift bridge's session-proof protocol. Its default port is also `45731`; choose another port when running it alongside the Swift app.

Build it from the repository root:

```sh
clang++ -std=c++17 -O2 -Wall -Wextra main.cpp -o build/hanasand-agent
```

On Windows, use a C++17 compiler and link Winsock. Run it with an optional port:

```sh
./build/hanasand-agent 45732
```
